Features:
- Multiple functions on the same keybind?
- Engine handled gamestates
	- gamestates are on a stack (when you close the menu it goes back to where you were automatically)
	- each gamestate has its own gameloop
	- each gamestate has its own set of keybinds
- Volume controls for audio
- Sprite virtual OnClick() method
	- detects when the sprite is clicked on
	- pass a mouse struct with all the necessary info
- Sprite collision detection
- Timers
	- ability to write a function that gets called automatically at some time interval
- Add color struct/union
	
Optimizations:
- Replace weak pointer system with integer ID lookup
- Make sure virtual calls are being devirtualized when there's only one possible function (final keyword)
- Look into ID2D1RenderTarget::PopLayer and PushLayer instead of the current layer system.
- Figure out that memory leak
